# MyFarm

**MyFarm** is a farming simulation game, the culminating project for the course CCPROG3 which serves as an introduction to object-oriented programming. In the game, the player acts as a farmer or manager of their own farm. As a sandbox-like simulation game, there is no main goal but the main gameplay involves doing the following:

- Buying seeds,
- Preparing land,
- Planting seeds,
- Advancing days to let crops grow, and
- Harvesting crops

`MCO1` contains the first iteration of the game which is launched via command-line, while `MCO2` contains the second and final iteration of the game which is played using a GUI.
